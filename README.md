SublimeMoveTabs
===============

A short plugin for [Sublime Text 2][1] that allows rearrangement of tabs/'views' with the keyboard.

Installation
============

Please use [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) to install this plugin. This will ensure that it will be updated when new versions are available. If you want to install from source so you can modify the source code, you probably know what you are doing so we wonâ€™t cover that here.

To install via Package Control, do the following:

1. Within Sublime Text, bring up the [Command Palette](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/sublime-text-3/extensibility/command_palette.html) and type `install`. Among the commands you should see `Package Control: Install Package`. If that command is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it. There will be a pause of a few seconds while Package Control fetches the list of available plugins.

2. When the plugin list appears, type `MoveT`. Among the entries you should see `MoveTab`. If that entry is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it.

How to Use
==========

Add keybindings for `move_view_left` and `move_view_right` at **Preferences -> Key binding -> User** or **Command Palette : Preferences : Key Bindings - User**. My example bindings on OS X:

    // Enable tab rearrangement
    { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+pageup"], "command": "move_view_left" },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+pagedown"], "command": "move_view_right" },
